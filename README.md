PPM is a templating and macro engine that allows you to:
- automate creating documents from
    - data 
    - other documents (think creating a table of contents or an index file).
- takes care of adding boilerplates for you

### The name
IT is called PPM because the commands use percent signs.
Basically, it's a boring joke.
